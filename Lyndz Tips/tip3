SETUP COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

I have TWO Gift Engine projects in my workspace:
1. Gift Engine Web App (React for browsers)
2. Gift Engine React Native App (iOS/Android mobile)

RIGHT NOW, I want to work on the WEB APP version.

I've completed the setup with:
- .windsurfrules (Gift Engine WEB APP upgrade rules)
- memory-bank/ directory (activeContext, productContext, progress, decisionLog)
- gift-engine-codemap.md (semantic project map for WEB APP)

Please:
1. Load project context from memory-bank/ and .windsurfrules
2. Load the codemap from gift-engine-codemap.md
3. Index the Gift Engine WEB APP codebase (React 19, not React Native)
4. Confirm when ready to start Phase 1: Core Modernization

Then analyze the WEB APP setup and create a detailed upgrade plan:

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Current React version â†’ React 19.2 upgrade path
- TikTok-Live-Connector: current vs latest stable
- npm audit: security vulnerabilities and fixes
- All outdated web dependencies requiring updates

**Web Performance Optimization:**
- WebGPU browser support for 3D effects
- Motion (Framer Motion) for animations
- Three.js optimization for browser rendering
- PWA service worker caching strategy

**Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari desktop testing
- iOS Safari and Chrome Android mobile browser testing

**Migration Plan Requirements:**
- Step-by-step React 19 upgrade sequence
- Peer dependency conflict resolution
- Risk assessment for each change
- Rollback plan if issues arise

Report back with findings BEFORE making any code changes.
